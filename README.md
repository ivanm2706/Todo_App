TodoApp is a web-based task management application that allows users to create, view and delete tasks in a convenient and intuitive interface.

The following technologies were used to develop TodoApp:

- Typescript is a programming language that provides static typing and additional functionality to JavaScript.

- npm is a package manager for installing and managing dependencies in a project.

- git is a version control system that allows you to track changes in your code and revert to previous versions as needed.

- React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

TodoApp was built with React, using a component approach to separate the interface into individual components.
